Credit Card Launch Analysis Project
Overview
This project entails a comprehensive analysis for a new credit card launch. The analysis is split into multiple phases, each dedicated to different aspects of data science to extract actionable insights. The ultimate goal is to utilize data-driven strategies for a successful market launch and targeted marketing.

Phases
Phase 1: Data Validation, Cleaning, and Visualization
Data Validation:

Ensured the accuracy and integrity of the acquired data.
Data Cleaning:

Addressed NULL values and treated outliers in critical metrics such as Annual Income and Age.
Data Visualization:

Generated various plots and graphs to visualize key metrics and trends:
Histograms: Distribution analysis of Annual Income and Transaction Amounts.
Bar Plots: Average Income by Occupation and other categories.
Pie Charts: Age group distribution.
Scatter Plots: Relationship between Credit Score and Credit Limit.
Boxplots: Distribution of Outstanding Debt.
